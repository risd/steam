- when map is up, can you turn off network scaling?
- when network is up, can you turn off arc scaling?

-modalflow
    - movement between forms
        - social auth selection -> waiting for social auth redirect
        - saving profile -> not editable -> back to editable
        - adding yourself -> awaiting confirmation -> link to profile
            - this has a rather useless in between step atm, but the beginnings of how this could be handled is here.

        - added .blanket to save profile process. implement a more usable version of it.

    - go through a clean sign up.

- push state? how does the back button work through all of this?

    - consider for:
        - current network being shown? go back between them?

        - most of the application is a single state. you are logged in, you can log out. you are looking at a network, you can close it. you aren't flipping through a bunch of lists.

@babette, ask about what kind of links you want to send out?
    - WA state? WA 8th district? both?
