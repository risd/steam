- look into other tile providers for competative prices
    - cloudmade?

- consider media queries

- delegate
    - no css animations?
        - fall back to css that does display: none/block
    - no svg support?
        - fall back to javascript that only gets you through sign up process. no map. no networks.

- add mixins for all transitions.

- remove `window.state` from `modalFlow.js`

- push state? how does the back button work through all of this?
    - http://programming.oreilly.com/2014/01/pushstate-to-the-future-progressive-enhancement-using-html5-pushstate-at-twitter.html

    - consider for:
        - current network being shown? go back between them?

        - most of the application is a single state. you are logged in, you can log out. you are looking at a network, you can close it. you aren't flipping through a bunch of lists.

- google analytics

- error reporting
    - https://www.getsentry.com/pricing/
        - could use a trial

- map to proper domain
    - map.stemtosteam.org
    - update stemtosteam.org to link to map
        - home page, "what can you do"
        - Take Action page, "what can you do"

- map.html, include search engine metadata

- language considerations
    - work in, make it clear to simply choose one above all
    - steam description, 'how do you engage with STEAM'
    - 'Join the Movement' modal header should be in sync with the buttons to get you there, which say 'Add Me', at the moment.


@babette, ask about what kind of links you want to send out?
    - WA state? WA 8th district? both?
