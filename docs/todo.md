- consider mobile network display
    - Make force network a single, vertical line, with names visible.
        - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/overflow

- remove main-nav header

- delegate
    - what does an incapable browser do? or do you polyfill it until it works?
    - mobile style sheets that disable filtering?

- add mixins for all transitions.

- remove `window.state` from `modalFlow.js`

- put css fallbacks in place for svg in stylesheet and modal_flow

- push state? how does the back button work through all of this?

    - consider for:
        - current network being shown? go back between them?

        - most of the application is a single state. you are logged in, you can log out. you are looking at a network, you can close it. you aren't flipping through a bunch of lists.

@babette, ask about what kind of links you want to send out?
    - WA state? WA 8th district? both?

- map to proper domain
